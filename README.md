ğŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm @Aussie-365.

ğŸš€ I love building cool projects and exploring new technologies. My areas of interest include web development and game development.

ğŸ’» Currently, I'm honing my skills in Python, Kotlin, Java and Javascript, but I'm always eager to learn new languages and frameworks.

ğŸŒ± Outside of coding, you can find me playing sports and playing games with friends.

ğŸ“« Feel free to connect with me on GitHub and replit. I'm always open to collaboration and new opportunities!
